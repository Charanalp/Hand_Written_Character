# Hand_Written_Character

# 📝 Handwritten Character Recognition System

This project is a **Handwritten Character Recognition System** that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize handwritten characters from the EMNIST dataset. The model can be extended to recognize entire words or sentences.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) and alphabets (A-Z, a-z)
- Built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**
- Can be extended for word and sentence recognition
- Easily deployable with high accuracy

---

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses the **EMNIST Dataset** (Extended MNIST), which includes handwritten digits and letters.  
- Dataset Link: [EMNIST Dataset](https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset)  

---

## 💡 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**  
- **TensorFlow & Keras**  
- **NumPy & Matplotlib**  
- **Google Colab**  
- **Git & GitHub**

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1️⃣ **Clone the Repository:**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Handwritten-Character-Recognition.git
cd Handwritten-Character-Recognition
2️⃣ Install Required Libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
3️⃣ Run the Code in Google Colab:

Open the notebook Handwritten_Character_Recognition.ipynb in Google Colab.
4️⃣ Train the Model:

python
Copy
Edit
# In Colab
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
5️⃣ Make Predictions:

python
Copy
Edit
prediction = model.predict(new_image)
print("Predicted Character:", np.argmax(prediction))
📈 Model Performance
Training Accuracy: ~99%
Validation Accuracy: ~98%
Can be improved further with hyperparameter tuning.
🚀 Future Improvements
Extend to recognize full words and sentences
Deploy as a web or mobile application
Integrate with OCR systems
